# VAE-for-Trajectory-Generation

This repository contains the models and scripts used during my internship, which was about the generation of social behaviors for robots, using generative models, such as the Variationnal Autoencoder. 
The recent development of robotics and artificial intelligence has led to a strong increase in the presence of social agents in everyday life 
(assistant integrated in telephones, automation of companies, etc.), and therefore in human-agent interactions. 
The success of these interactions depends on the ability of social agents to adopt behaviors that are easily understood by humans. 
This problem, which is relatively rare for virtual agents, is preponderant for physical agents.

During my internship, we tried to develop models capable of easily generating different types of behaviors and movements for robots, using generative models like VAE.
We were particularly interested in the notion of legibility of a movement. During the project, we therefore sought to recreate an experiment by Anca D Dragan (http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss09/p24.pdf)
on the generation of legible trajectories for a robot, but using VAE instead of its optimization technique.

Our architecture is composed of two VAE. The first one is used to generate trajectories to several possible destinations, defined in a discrete way.
The second one, trained from examples generated by the first one, is used to control the latent space of the first VAE according to legibility, in order to obtain 
trajectories with the desired degree of legibility (also defined in a discrete way).

The legibility evaluation is based on Dragan's formulas.
The first VAE must be trained with a dataset generated by the script Training_generation.py
